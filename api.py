'''
__name__ argument is passed to the Flask class when creating an instance of the Flask application.
This helps with -
1. Resource Identification: The __name__ variable helps Flask to identify the root path of the application. 
2. Debugging and Logging: Flask uses the __name__ attribute for debugging purposes and to identify the name of the application in log messages. 
This is particularly useful when multiple Flask applications are running on the same server
